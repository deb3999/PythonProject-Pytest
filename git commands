Create a folder 
Launch gitbash 
cd "path of the folder e.g gitone"
git status
git init
open the folder in PyCharm as a new project e.g. gitone
touch fileone.txt filetwo.txt
git add fileone.txt  (to track the file)
git commit -m "added file one"
git log
git log --oneline
git log --stat  To see which files changed in each commit
git branch
git branch featurebranchname
open the file and modify save, add, and commit
git switch main
git merge featurebranchname -- It will give a successful result 

now we are in main branch modify the same file , Add, commit, 
then switch to feature branch, modify the same file again,save add and commit.
git switch main
git merge featurebranchname -- It will give a conflict.-- conflict occurs when same line in same file is modified by two users/branches.

git stash --means save your work temporarily and can switch to another branch.
git stash pop -- means bring back the saved files and start working on those files again.  

git add -add the changes from working directory to staging env
git commit - add those changes from staging to local git repo
git push origin -send those local commits to a remote feature branch
Pull request -- Request to merge the changes present in remote feature branch to master branch


git branch -d branchname -- delete the local branch

git switch main -- in local
git push origin main
git pull origin main - fetches remote repo changes to local main
or simply git pull

git diff filename == gives the difference between working directory and staging.(after running add command if we modify the file again in working directory)
git diff HEAD filename == gives the difference between working directory and latest commit
git diff --staged HEAD filename ==gives difference between staged and latest commit
git diff commitid filename == gives difference between working directory and particular commit
git diff commitid1 commitid2 filename == gives difference between two commits
git diff branch1 branch2  == gives difference between two local branches
git diff main origin/main == gives the difference between local main and remote main branch

git rm filename ==deletes the file from both working directory and staging
git rm  --staged filename == deletes the file from  staging only
rm filename == deletes the file from the working directory only

git checkout filename == discards unstaged changes in tracked file (working directory >staging>committed >add two lines in working directory file>checkout >it will be again same as committed file)

git reset filename == revoke changes from staging 
git reset mode commitid == undo commit  

git reset --soft commitid == discards the (changes or)commits done after the mentioned commitid from local repo only. Changes will be there in staging and working directory.
git reset --mixed commitid == discards the commits, done after the mentioned commit-id from local repo and staging. Changes will be there in WD
git reset --hard commitid == discards the commits done after the mentioned commit-id from local repo staging and working directory.

Branches are isolated/independent to each other.

Realtime work --
Lead has to create a repository in GitHub. Repository name should be same as project name.Then copy the link.
Lead has to create a project with some dummy files in IDE and initialize git repo in the project folder, run git add . and commit it to local git repo in "main" branch . 
Then establish the relation with GitHub by running below query.  
git remote add origin "https://github.com/deb3999/PythonProject-Pytest.git"

and then push the local "main" branch to  GitHub repository where "main" branch will be created in GitHub.
git push -u origin main

Now all test engineer will clone the repo and open the project in IDE. Create a new branch in local git.e.g. git branch feature1 , git switch feature1  > Do the modification in code and commit..Push the local feature branch to GitHub. 
git push -u origin feature1

Then create pull request to review in GITHUB..Once the review is successfully finished. It will be merged to main branch in GitHub.


Now the 2nd tester created a new file and pushed it to GitHub Main branch.

Then to get latest files -1st tester will run : git pull origin main   >> This means--Data will come from GitHub Repo Main Branch
Now feature1 branch will have tester2 changes. 

Now add another file, run git push-- the remote feature1 branch will be updated
from there create another pull request.

git remote add origin "https://github.com/deb3999/PythonProject-Pytest.git"
git push -u origin <your-branch-name> == Push your local branch to the remote repository on GitHub: After that create a Pull request.
git pull origin main === Make sure your local branch has the latest changes from the remote

when feature branch 1 is merged to Main branch, and in feature branch 2 we added a new file > committed and trying to merge to main branch - it will ask merge commit message. but NOT THE CONFLICT
